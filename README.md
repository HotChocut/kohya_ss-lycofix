# kohya_ss-lycofix
A simple batchscript that you place into your main kohya_ss directory and run to fix not being able to train/extract lyco based off @kaan36875's [fix](https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss/issues/1129#issuecomment-1626372311) that worked for me.
This only works if your directory is a git directory and if you've already run the setup.bat
