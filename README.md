# kohya_ss-lycofix
A simple batchscript that you place into your main kohya_ss directory and run to fix not being able to train/extract lyco based off @kaan36875's [fix](https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss/issues/1129#issuecomment-1626372311) that worked for me.
This only works if your directory is a git directory and if you've already run the setup.bat

If you don't know how to do those two things here's a brief rundown for windows users
1. Go into the directory you want to install kohya_ss into
2. Chick on the directory at the top of file explorer (example: C:\software), type "cmd" and press enter
4. Run `git clone https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss` into the console and when it's done you can close it
5. Go into the newly created "kohya_ss" directory created and run "setup.bat" and follow the steps as prompted
6. Place "fix-lyco.bat" into your "kohya_ss" directory and run it
7. Enjoy!
