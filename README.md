# kohya_ss-lycofix
A simple batchscript that literally just runs @kaan36875's [fix](https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss/issues/1129#issuecomment-1626372311) for being unable to train/extract LyCORIS LoCON.
(This only works after you have completed "setup.bat")

To use this literally just drop "lycofix.bat" into your kohya_ss main directory (where "setup.bat" is located) and run it, as long as you have ran "setup.bat" and completed the setup it should work.
