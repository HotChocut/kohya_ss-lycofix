# kohya_ss-lycofix
A simple batchscript that you place into your main kohya_ss directory and run to fix not being able to train/extract lyco based off @kaan36875's [fix](https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss/issues/1129#issuecomment-1626372311) that worked for me.
This only works if your directory is a git directory and if you've already run the setup.bat

If you don't know how to do those two things here's a brief rundown for windows users
1. Go into the directory you want to install kohya_ss into
2.  run `git clone https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss`
3.  Go into the kohya_ss directory created and run "setup.bat" and fallow the steps as prompted
4.  Afterwards you can place "fix-lyco.bat" into your kohya_ss main directory and run it
